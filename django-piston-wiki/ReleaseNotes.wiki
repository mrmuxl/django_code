This is mainly a bugfix release. Many patches/improvements received from various contributors. Should be 100% backwards compatible, and does not introduce any major features.

== 0.2.1 (released on May 19th, 2009) ==

Get [[http://bitbucket.org/jespern/django-piston/downloads/django-piston-0.2.1.tar.gz|0.2.1 here]].

Major features include: Receiving expressive data, as POST-data is limited to basic key-value pairs. When client posts with a known content-type (e.g. application/json), Piston will automatically deserialize it, and place it in request.data. It will also set request.content_type to not-None, so you can easily write your handlers to support both. In case you only want to receive expressive data, the @require_mime and @require_extended decorators are very useful.
